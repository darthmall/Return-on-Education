                        <h5>Net Present Value</h5>
                        <p>Each circle&rsquo;s area corresponds to the <em>Net Present Value</em> of its demographic. The <em>Net Present Value</em> is the amount of additional money (in U.S. Dollars) someone in that demographic earns over the course of their working life as a result of attaining that level of education after subtracting the cost of that education.</p>

                        <h5>Post-Secondary Education</h5>
                        <p>Straddles the boundary between upper-secondary (10<sup>th</sup>&ndash;12<sup>th</sup> grade) and tertiary (college or university) education. Enrollment lasts between six months and two years of full-time study. There are two types of post-secondary education: one prepares students for entry into tertiary education programs; the other prepares them for entry directly into the workforce.</p>

                        <h5>Tertiary Education</h5>
                        <p>Can be broken down into two types of education. <em>Tertiary-type A</em> is largely theory-based and lasts at least three years of full-time study, but is typically four or more. <em>Tertiary-type A</em> programs prepare students to enter advanced research programs or professions with high skill requirements such as medecine. This type of Tertiary education includes second-degree programs such as the American Master&rsquo;s degree.</p>

                        <p><em>Tertiary-type B</em> programs focus on more practical skills than <em>Tertiary-type A</em> programs. These programs have a minimum duration of two years of full-time study.</p>

                    <article id="costs" style="display:none">
                        <h2>Who pays more?</h2>
                        <p>Comparing the costs to the public and private sectors of obtaining a higher education we can see that the cost to the public sector for <em>Post-Secondary</em> education is often higher than the cost to the private sector. The reverse appears to be true for <em>Tertiary</em> education.</p>

                        <h5>Private Costs</h5>
                        <p>Include the direct cost to the student (tuition, &amp;c.) as well as the estimated foregone earnings because he or she is not working while attending school. Costs also include additional taxes paid as a result of higher earnings after obtaining the higher education.</p>

                        <h5>Public Costs</h5>
                        <p>Include the direct cost to the public for the education as well as foregone taxes because the student is not working.</p>

                        <h5>Income Tax Effect</h5>
                        <p>The area of each circle corresponds to the amount of additional taxes an individual pays as a result of higher earnings after obtaining that level of education. One reason that <em>Tertiary</em> education may cost an individual more than it costs the public is that they pay more in taxes than someone with a <em>Post-Secondary</em> education&emdash;so the public recoups the foregone taxes the education cost them once the student returns to the workforce.</p>

                        <h2>How do costs affect Net Present Value?</h2>
                        <p>Each pie chart is sized according to the gross benefits an individual receives in a given country based on their gender and level of education. Costs are then displayed as slices of the pie chart, leaving the <em>Net Present Value</em> as the colored section of the chart.</p>
