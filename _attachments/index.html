                    <h2>Net Present Value</h2>
                    <p>This chart compares the <em>Net Present Value</em> for men and women with a <em>Post-Secondary (Non-Tertiary)</em> or <em>Tertiary</em> education.</p>

                    <h5>Net Present Value</h5>
                    <p>Each circle's area corresponds to the Net Present Value of its demographic. The Net Present Value is the amount of additional money (in U.S. Dollars) someone in that demographic earns over the course of their working life as a result of attaining that level of education after subtracting the cost of that education.</p>

                    <h2>Who pays more?</h2>
                    <p>Comparing the costs to the public and private sectors of obtaining a higher education we can see that the cost to the public sector for <em>Post-Secondary</em> education is often higher than the cost to the private sector. The reverse appears to be true for <em>Tertiary</em> education.</p>

                    <h5>Private Costs</h5>
                    <p>Include the direct cost to the student (tuition, &amp;c.) as well as the estimated foregone earnings because he or she is not working while attending school. Costs also include additional taxes paid as a result of higher earnings after obtaining the higher education.</p>

                    <h5>Public Costs</h5>
                    <p>Include the direct cost to the public for the education as well as foregone taxes because the student is not working.</p>

                    <h5>Income Tax Effect</h5>
                    <p>The area of each circle corresponds to the amount of additional taxes an individual pays as a result of higher earnings after obtaining that level of education. One reason that <em>Tertiary</em> education may cost an individual more than it costs the public is that they pay more in taxes than someone with a <em>Post-Secondary</em> education&emdash;so the public recoups the foregone taxes the education cost them once the student returns to the workforce.</p>
